TA in office -- thread
students waiting for help.
one students enters office
3 students in chair
if more comes ask them to do programming --- thread(sleep)
after help student goes out
TA should check any occupants in seat. If present call the student in first chair(Loop for 3) if all chairs vacant he can go to sleeping
else
go to sleep
if a student comes while he is sleeping. Give a wake up call using semaphore
I think TA is the critical resource.
